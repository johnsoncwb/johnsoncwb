### Hi there! ðŸ¤“

As a frontend mobile developer, I specialize in using React Native, Redux, and Styled Components to create stunning, user-friendly mobile applications. I have extensive knowledge of analytics in React Native, including how to use Firebase, Facebook Pixel, Appsflyer, and Segment to optimize app performance and user engagement.

While I enjoy working on the frontend, I have a deep passion for backend development. I have recently begun exploring Go, and I have created several highly successful applications that are used by over 1 million people each month. These applications include a mobile app product screen that is like a BFF for users, as well as a code generator for every mobile installation.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a number of soft skills that make me an asset to any team. I am a quick learner when it comes to new technologies, and I have a natural ability to work well with others in a team environment. I am proactive and take initiative to make sure projects are completed on time and to the highest standards.

Overall, my combination of technical skills, passion for backend development, and soft skills make me a valuable addition to any project. Whether you are looking to build a mobile app from scratch or improve an existing application, I have the skills and experience to help you achieve your goals.
